# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
* The provisional database used for Segment-1 is SQLite with SQLAlchemy.
* Either Mongo or PostgreSQL would be the target database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is to use TensorFlow.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard, and using Tableau for visualizations. It will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
