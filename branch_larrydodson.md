## Results


   ### Deliverable 1: Presentation
   
   * Selected topic:  Food Deserts in the U.S.
  
   * Reason why this topic was selected: 
  
   * Description of the source data: from kaggle, Food access research data. 
  
   * Questions hoping to answer with the data: 
    1. a
    2. b
    3. c

  
   .
  
   
   ### Deliverable 2: GitHub
   
   * READ.me established 
   * Description of the communication protocols 
   * Individual Branches established, and each team member with min of four commits 
   
   
   
   . 
   
   
   ### Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   
   * Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database
      - Outputs labels for input data

   
   .
   
   
   ### Deliverable 4: Database
   
   * Present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
