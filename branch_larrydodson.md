## Results


   ### Deliverable 1: Presentation
   
   * Selected topic:  Food Deserts in the U.S.
  
   * Reason why this topic was selected: Vertical farming and urban farming are becoming more prescient topics as climate change and increased urbanization of population occcurs.  Timely and accurate understanding of what locations can be considered "food deserts" can aid urban planning to preempt possible, or increasing, food scarcity in heavily urbanized locations.  This understanding can assist in increasing life-span, quality of life and resource allocation for future generations.
  
   * Description of the source data: The data was retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tcrammond/food-access-and-food-deserts).  The data comes from the United States Department of Agriculture on census-tract level data on access to supermarkets.
  
   * Questions hoping to answer with the data: 
    1. a
    2. b
    3. c

  
   .
  
   
   ### Deliverable 2: GitHub
   
   * READ.me established 
   * Description of the communication protocols 
   * Individual Branches established, and each team member with min of four commits 
   
   
   
   . 
   
   
   ### Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   
   * Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database
##### Outputs labels for input data

1. Target/Output variable = 

    **LILATracts_1And10**

          Low income and low access tract measured at 1 mile for urban areas and 10 miles for rural areas	
                          
2. Feature variables =
    1. lasnaphalf
          
    2. lasnapshare
    3. lahunvhalf
    4. lahunvshare
    5. lasnap1
    6. lasnap1share
    7. lahunv1
    8. lahunv1share
    9. lasnap10
    10. lasnap10share
    11. lahunv10
    12. lahunv10share
    13. lasnap20
    14. lasnap20share
    15. lahunv20
    16. lahunv20share


   
   .
   
   
   ### Deliverable 4: Database
   
   * Present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
